# TimeMyTalk
Simple countdown timer with large fonts for conference talks. Useful when you want to make sure that presenters do not go overtime.

## Example use:
You will need either an old laptop or:
* a relatively big flat screen (nowadays people throw these away)
* a raspberry pi with HDMI cable and possibly adapters to the screen
* a wireless keyboard

Now you can:
1) Attach the respberry pi to the screen so that the whole thing is easy to carry (or use the laptop)
2) place the screen so that both the audience and the presenter can easily see it to improve shame factor ;)
3) start `TimeMyTalk.py` and make it full screen (press `f`)
4) sit in the audience with the wireless keyboard to set, start and stop the timer

You can either control the tool with the mouse and buttons (press `c` to make them visible), or use the keyboard (see the instructons in `TimeMyTalk.py` for details). Three preset talk durations have been included to simplify the use (select them with the keys `1`, `2`, and `3`). You can easily modify the presets in the code, if you need to. You can also set the duration freely by pressing `s`.
