# TimeMyTalk
Simple countdown timer with large fonts for conference talks

## Example use:
You will need:
* relatively big flat screen (nowadays people throw these away)
* raspberry pi with HDMI cable and possibly adapters to the screen
* wireless keyboard

Now you can:
1) Attach the respberry pi to the screen so that the whole thing is easy to carry
2) place the screen so that both the audience and the presenter can easily see it
3) sit in the audience with the wireless keyboard to set, start and stop the timer
